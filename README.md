# typescript-modules

Try out various stuff creating modules and libraries in js, ts, angular

# commonjs:

Try out file with cmd: node main.js

# typescript:

Compiling node main.ts does not work. Needs to be compiled first.
Hence, tsconfig.json is required.

Cd to the typescript dir (typescript-example) and call the typescript compiler with: tsc.
Dist folder will be created (the outDir of tsconfig.json). Cd to here and type node main.js again.
