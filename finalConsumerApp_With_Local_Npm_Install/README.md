# FinalConsumerAppWithLocalNpmInstall

On of the final consumer apps where an example is provided with a LOCAL npm install of the previously created libraries.

npm i, one folder back and then the application, dist folder and library:
npm i ..\angular-cli-demo\dist\my-console-logger\
npm i ..\angular-cli-demo\dist\my-login\

In the package.json you see a reference to the specific folders. Can use them now as normal.
